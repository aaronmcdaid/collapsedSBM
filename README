This is an MCMC algorithm to cluster the nodes of a network according
to the Stochastic Blockmodel of Nowicki & Snijders 2001.
As described in our draft on arXiv [1].

   == Compiling ==

To get the latest code from github and compile:

     git clone --recursive -o github git://github.com/aaronmcdaid/collapsedSBM.git
     cd collapsedSBM
     make

   == Running ==

You can simply run it with

     ./sbm edge_list.txt -z output.txt

where edge_list.txt is your edge list file, made up of one line per edge.
Each line gives the two nodes that are connected, separated by whitespace.

By default, the network is treated as unweighted and undirected.
To use other options, run

     ./sbm --help

There will be a lot of debugging output printed to the screen, but the
important output will be stored in output.txt (or whichever filename
you specify for '-z').  To apply the label-(un)switching procedure,
described in section 5.6 of our draft [1], you can then run:

    ./labels < output.txt > output_unswitched.txt

This file, 'output_unswitched.txt' will be the most useful form of
output - you should now see that most nodes spend the vast majority of
their time in one cluster, in constrast with the regular relabelling of
clusters within 'output.txt'.
