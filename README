   == Compiling ==

     git clone -o github git://github.com/aaronmcdaid/collapsedSBM.git
     cd collapsedSBM/
     git submodule init
     git submodule update
     make clean sbm labels

   == Running ==

You can simply run it with

     ./sbm edge_list.txt

where edge_list.txt is your edge list file, made up of one line per edge.
Each line gives the two nodes that are connected, separated by whitespace.

By default, the network is treated as unweighted and undirected.
To use other options, run

     ./sbm --help
