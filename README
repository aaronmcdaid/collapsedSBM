   == collapsed Stochastic Block Modelling ==

This is an MCMC algorithm to cluster the nodes of a network according
to the Stochastic Blockmodel of Nowicki & Snijders 2001.
As described in our draft on arXiv [1].

   == Compiling ==

To get the latest code from github and compile:

     git clone --recursive -o github git://github.com/aaronmcdaid/collapsedSBM.git
     cd collapsedSBM
     make

   == Running ==

You can simply run it with

     ./sbm edge_list.txt

where edge_list.txt is your edge list file, made up of one line per edge.
Each line gives the two nodes that are connected, separated by whitespace.

By default, the network is treated as unweighted and undirected.
To use other options, run

     ./sbm --help

The output will contain a lot of summary information on the results of the
algorithm.  Hopefully much of it will be self-explanatory - don't hesitate
to contact me if you have any questions or requests [2].  There is a large
table near the end of the output will lists every node, showing how many
iterations the node spent in each of the clusters.

The final line of output will be a simple clustering of the nodes, where
each node has been assigned to the single cluster to which it is most
strongly assigned.

I would appreciate any feedback, and would be willing to make changes if
you have any requests.
